# AI Agent Instructions
## Project Overview
OpenShift Layered Product Quality Engineering Tooling repository containing shared tools and utilities for testing OpenShift Layered Products. The repository
follows a modular structure with individual applications, shared libraries, and container image build definitions.

## Key Constraints
- Follow bash scripting best practices as defined in the team wiki.
- **Best Practices**: Re-read https://edttjredhat.github.io/RHP-Wiki/Confluence/MPEXIENG/Test+Infrastructure/Best+Practises/Section0.html at:
  - Start of new sessions.
  - Session resume (when continuing from a previous conversation).
  - Before writing NEW bash scripts or functions (not minor edits to existing code).
  - When user explicitly requests best practices review.
- Each application should be self-contained within its `apps/<appName>/` directory.
- Use shared libraries in `libs/` for code reused across applications.
- Container images are built from `image/container/<appName>/` using Dockerfiles and Makefiles.

## Architecture Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Applications under `apps/`, container builds under `image/container/`, shared code under `libs/`.
- **Directory Naming**: Use `src/` (3 chars), `test/` (4 chars, optional), `docs/` (4 chars, optional) for consistency.
- **AI Instructions**: Each application can have its own `.AI_README.md` for app-specific context.
- **Change Tracking**: Use `.AI_HISTORY.md` to track significant changes per directory scope.

## Common Tasks
- **Building container images**: Navigate to `image/container/<appName>` and run `make build`.
- **Running tests**: Navigate to `apps/<appName>` and execute app-specific test commands.
- **Adding shared code**: Place reusable libraries in `libs/bash/` or `libs/python/` as appropriate.

## Dependencies and Setup
- Bash shell scripting environment.
- Docker or Podman for container image builds.
- Make for build automation.
- Application-specific dependencies are documented in each app's README.md.
