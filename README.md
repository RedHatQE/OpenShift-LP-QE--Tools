## Applications

### [prow-analyzer](apps/prow-analyzer/)
Automated Prow CI failure analysis using Red Hat's ship-help MCP (AI helpdesk).

**Features:**
- CLI tool for manual Prow URL analysis
- Slack bot for automated channel monitoring
- Integrates with ship-help MCP (9+ data sources: Jira, GitHub, Firewatch, build logs)
- Reduces failure triage from 30-60 minutes to 2 minutes

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd apps/prow-analyzer
go build ./cmd/prow-analyzer--cli
./prow-analyzer--cli analyze <prow-url>
```

See [apps/prow-analyzer/README.md](apps/prow-analyzer/README.md) for full documentation.

## Directory Conventions
### `apps/`
Application code organized by application name. Each application is self-contained with its own source, tests, and documentation.

### `image/container/`
Container Image build definitions. Each application has a corresponding directory with its Dockerfile and Makefile.

Shared Makefile includes for common build patterns are in `common/Makefile.inc/`.

### `libs/`
Shared libraries that can be sourced or imported by multiple applications. Organized by programming or scripting language.

### `tools/`
Repository-level maintenance scripts for building, testing, linting, and releasing.

## AI Agent Instructions
This repository uses a unified AI agent instruction system:
- The `.AI_INIT.md` contains the main instructions.
- The AI Agent specific default files, e.g. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.continuerules`, `.cursorrules`, etc., are symbolic links to `.AI_INIT.md`.
- Each application can have its own `.AI_README.md` for app-specific context.
- Change history is tracked in `.AI_HISTORY.md` files.

## Getting Started
### Building an Application
```bash
cd image/container/<appName>
make build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cd apps/<appName>
# Run app-specific tests.
```

## Contributing
- Follow the directory structure conventions.
- Update `.AI_HISTORY.md` for significant changes.
- Ensure each application has proper documentation in its `README.md`.
- Use shared libraries in `libs/` when code is reused across applications.
- See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution conventions and workflow details.
